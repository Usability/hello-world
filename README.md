A repository is usually used to organize a single project

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
 By default your repository has one branch named master (production)
  We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master
saved changes are called commits
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
